## Question 1:
Assuming the volunteers are representative of the cityâ€™s population, characterize the distinct areas of the city that you identify. For each area you identify, provide your rationale and supporting data. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words. \ 
\ 
Distinct area: \ 

 * 1. the area in which population shows a clear pattern. eg. high education area, high income area, area of elder people, area of young people etc.
 * 2. the distinct area in terms of the usage of the buildings: the business area,  the residential area and the recreational area. 

### data to be used: \
* participant attribute data
* participant journal data (to find out their living address)
* building data, employer data, pubs and restaurant data, school data all combined together.

### Data wrangling:  
goal: 2 dataframes:  
1. the location and attribute of participants  
2. the location and usage of buildings  
the data wrangling is omitted here, 

## plotting  



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#import packages:
packages = c( 'sf','tmap','tidyverse','lubridate',
              'clock','sftime','rmarkdown')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}

```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#import dataset
building=read_sf('data/buildingtype.csv',options='GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location')

#categories polt
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(building)+
  tm_polygons(col='category',
  size=1,
  border.col='black',
  border.lwd=1)

#commercial vs residential area plot
tm_shape(building)+
  tm_polygons(col='buildingType',
  size=1,
  border.col='black',
  border.lwd=1)
tmap_mode('plot')

```
  
  
### distinct area in terms of building usage:  

\  
There is a clear pattern of the business area and residential area, the business area include the northwest, the central and the south region, the residential area surrounds the business area.  
\  
\ The business area refers to the area with more commercial buildings. From the second figure, we can find 3 business area in the city:

* 1. The first located in the northwest of the city. 
* 2. The second and the largest CBD in the upper central region of the city.
* 3. The third located in the northern part of the city.  

### distinct area in terms of population attribute: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
homeloc=read_sf('data/homeloc.csv',options='GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=currentLocation')
part=read_csv('data/Participants.csv')
locattr=merge(x = homeloc, y = part, by = "participantId", all.x = TRUE)

```
```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(building)+
  tm_polygons(col='grey60',
  size=1,
  border.col='black',
  border.lwd=1)+
tm_shape(locattr)+
  tm_facets(by=c("educationLevel"), ncol =1)+
  tm_dots(col='educationLevel',
  size=0.1)
tmap_mode('plot')

```
\  
there is a vague pattern of the low education participants' residence: they tend to live in the northwest area.  
the rest education groups does not display a clear pattern 
\  

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(building)+
  tm_polygons(col='grey60',
  size=1,
  border.col='black',
  border.lwd=1)+
tm_shape(locattr)+
  tm_dots(col='age',
  size=0.1)
tmap_mode('plot')

```
\  
From the age regional distribution plot we find that , there is a gathering of elderly people in the northwest corner of the city. In general, the northwest region is more crowded than the rest region of the city.

### Question 2:
\ Where are the busiest areas in Engagement? Are there traffic bottlenecks that should be addressed? Explain your rationale. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.  

\ Where are the busiest areas in Engagement?  

```{r}
log_selected<-read_rds('data/logs_selected.rds')
hex <- st_make_grid(building, #define the bbox 
                    cellsize=100, #dimention:100x100
                    square=FALSE) %>%
  st_sf() %>%
  rowid_to_column('hex_id')
points_in_hex <- st_join(log_selected, 
                        hex, 
                        join=st_within) %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  count(name='pointCount', hex_id)

hex_combined <- hex %>%
  left_join(points_in_hex, 
            by = 'hex_id') %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0)
#plot the count of people appearing in a certain region 
tm_shape(hex_combined %>%
           filter(pointCount > 0))+
  tm_fill("pointCount",
          n = 8,
          style = "quantile") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.1)
```
The busiest area is along the connection between the business regions.  
\  
Are there traffic bottlenecks that should be addressed

```{r}
log_path <- log_selected %>%
  group_by(participantId, day) %>%
  summarize(m = mean(Timestamp), 
            do_union=FALSE) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING")
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(building)+
tm_polygons(col = "grey60",
           size = 1,
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1) +
  tm_shape(log_path) +
  tm_dots(col = "blue")
tmap_mode("plot")
```
